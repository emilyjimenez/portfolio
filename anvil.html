        <h1>Anvil Media Internship</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Working for Anvil was a great experience and I learned a lot about digital marketing. Design, research, and planning, were apart of my daily routine and my role as a marketing intern. Recently the company updated their logo, so Iâ€™ helped redesign their marketing collateral to go with the new branding, and also improved the overall appearance. A lot of my projects at Anvil also involved research; I assisted with business development, and client research for different marketing strategies.</p>
