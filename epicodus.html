      <p>In Fall 2017, I decided to sharpen my skillset so I enrolled at Epicodus. Epicodus is a 7-month, intensive coding school that teaches students front-end, back-end, web and app development. I chose the back-end route, and focused on C#, JavaScript, and .net coding languages. Below are some samples of projects I completed during school. Click the links below if you'd like to see them on my GitHub account.</p>

        <strong>Attention teachers grading this!</strong> My current projects <em>suuck</em>, I wouldnt normally put these on my portfolio but I know it's a requirement for this independent project. I plan on using this page to build on a real portfolio later and will change the projects with ACTUAL good projects. ;)
